Noble Modules Unit Tests, Applied to BravoJS
============================================
**A NobleJS production**

Copyright Â© 2011 Barnesandnoble.com llc. Released under the [MIT License][1].

We apply the applicable subset of the Noble Modules unit tests to the preexisting [BravoJS][2] Modules/2.0 
implementation. The hope is that, by doing so and discussing the resulting failures, the CommonJS community can use 
the Noble Modules unit tests as a basis for a canonical set of Modules/2.0 conformance tests.
